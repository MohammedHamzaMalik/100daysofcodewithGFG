Explanation:
In this I have simply used the for loops and if condition.
1 -> first I have made a new array in which I will be storing the elements of both of the arrays
2 -> then I have iterated over the first array and added of its element in the final array
3 -> similarly I have done the same process on the second array
4 -> then using sort built-in method I have sorted the final array (you can use any of the sorting method)
5 -> then I have iterated over the final array and checked if the position of any of the element of the final array is eqaul to k. If yes then I have returned the element just before the position which is equal to k.
