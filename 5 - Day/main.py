Explanation:
We are given two arrays which are sorted for length m,n respectively.
...
1 -> first I have made a new final_array and have added both the array in it.
2 -> then I have sorted the final_array using the .sort method.
3 -> made a new variable 'size' which will contain the size of the final_array.
4 -> then using a simple if else condition, I have checked if the size is odd then it will return the middle element.
5 -> else if the size is even then the median will be the average of elements at index ((m+n)/2 â€“ 1) and (m+n)/2 in the array.
6 -> then in the else condition itself, I have added another if else condition.
7 -> this will check if the median is an integer type then it will return a median of int type.
8 -> if it is not an integer type then it will return a float type value.
